## Features

* **Black: Format** to format the file in place using [black](https://github.com/ambv/black).

## Prerequisites

* Install [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) and ensure you can use it in command line to format files.

### Directly from the repository

Clone the git repo into your `Packages` folder and restart SublimeText3

### Package Control

Submitted to Package Control on May 1st 2018. Should be available soon!

## Notes

* More to come as soon as SublimeText supports latest python version.
